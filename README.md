# dorado-boot-animation

This is an updated boot animation used by the Quantify ROM, specifically made for the Verizon Wear24 (Quanta Dorado).

There are two [releases](https://github.com/quantify-nfc/dorado-boot-animation/releases): **public** and **beta**.

**Beta** contains an audio file to be played on start-up. This is used to indicate the user is using a beta build. Other than that, the boot animations are identical.

Yes. The start-up sound is the Windows XP start up sound because why not.
